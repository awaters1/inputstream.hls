How the addon works
1. Reads the MPD file to get the URLs and other metadata
2. When playback is started Kodi is passed 2 streams, one for video 
one for audio
3. When kodi requests demuxed data it finds out which stream is next
and obtains the data for that stream.  If the data isn't in the buffer
it requests the next segment from the HTTP server
4. The demuxed data is returned


For HLS it would work the same, but instead of using demux we
would use ReadStream because our data is multiplexed and needs to be
demuxed by kodi itself

HLS
1. Read the main playlist file into an HLSObject
2. Represent the separate HLS playlist as HLSStream
3. A HLSStream is represented of multiple segments

Need to decrypt the TS before passing it to readStream
(can use OpenSSL to do this, just fetch the key and IV
from the playlist file)

Need to figure out if the TS file can be played without the
metadata from the HLS file, and if the metadata is only for loading
up the TS files


1. Need to determine if we can get away with ReadSteam
or if we have to use demux
2. HLS files can have separate audio streams
-> not sure if we can support this without demux.
if we use demux then we need to load in
mpeg2ts and demux it before seding to kodi
