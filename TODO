1. When coming back from a commercial it doesn't always start playing
2. Make it so we don't switch streams so aggresively based on the bandwidth amount

3. See if there is a way to handle when the bandwidth drops to very low levels
and kodi ends up skipping or fast forwarding
(maybe send empty demux packets?)
4. Maybe continue to load the variant playlist in the background because seeking is lost when swithching streams

1. Find out when a playlist is invalid

1. sometimes there are minor hiccups, not
sure if they are caused by the demuxing process or just the video syncing
(caused by my computer, doesn't happen on dedicated kodi box)

Test
1. Loss of network

Bugs


4. Need to be able to quit everything instead of stalling sometimes when we want to exit
like when downloading
5. Stream switching causes a segment pause in 30 for 30, but worked okay in live stream
-> May be due to resolution change and VAAPI
7. Handle when there is no data, we shoudln't stallin this case
-> can return an empty demux packet to get it to show the loading indicator
9. Discontinuity playlist ends 10  frames too early
10. Sometimes the current time exceeds the total playlist time, may be due to stalling

Seeking
1. Cache file downloads
