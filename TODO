Bugs
4. Need to be able to quit everything instead of stalling sometimes when we want to exit
like when downloading
5. Stream switching causes a segment pause in 30 for 30, but worked okay in live stream
6. Sometimes live streams get stuck in commercials and come back and skip some video,
may be related to PTS/DTS values changing in the embedded video
7. Handle when there is no data, we shoudln't stallin this case
