Priorities:
1. Switching between variant streams




1. Support rest of addon interface
2. Be able to switch to a variant playlist during playing
3. Support a live stream


Issues
1. Memory leak when running in Kodi - maybe due to kodi_hls.cpp not have destructors?
2. Timestamps
3. Commercial seemed to start randomly - maybe due to discontinuity flag
