TODO: When seeking we should just destroy our demuxer
and create a whole new one

Bugs
1. Have to handle when the playlist is done, right now we hang in
ReadAV() waiting for data. -> same thing happens with seeking
-> Can do for non-live streams but for live streams how do we know
when they are done?
2. GetTotalTime doesn't seem to work anymore due to loading the playlist async for 
non-live streams
4. Need to be able to quit everything instead of stalling sometimes when we want to exit
like when downloading
5. Stream switching causes a segment pause in 30 for 30, but worked okay in live stream
6. Sometimes live streams get stuck in commercials
7. Seeking doesn't work in the live stream - may be due to the start PTS value, not sure how kodi
calculates the absolute time to seek to in DemuxSeekTime because it is too large
8. For live streams tho current progress isn't updated immediately - may be causing the seek issue
9. Fix issues with current time and total time resetting, maybe cache old value
when switching streams?

Seeking
1. Switching streams (goes hand in hand with seeking)
1. Cache file downloads
2. Fix atomic_bool and mutex locking of threads

Release TODO:
1. Support stream switching
2. Save previous bandwidth
-> Use 4mbits as default
-> Bandwidth settings
3. Support resume from for non-live streams
4. Seek live streams

Issues:
2. Some times it stalls attempting to download, not sure if it is because we attempt to download
the segment as soon as we see it

Features:
1. Seek
2. Rest of addon interface
3. Memory management

Missing Support
1. Other HLS features
