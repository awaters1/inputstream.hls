Bugs
4. Need to be able to quit everything instead of stalling sometimes when we want to exit
like when downloading
5. Stream switching causes a segment pause in 30 for 30, but worked okay in live stream
6. Sometimes live streams get stuck in commercials


Seeking
1. Cache file downloads
2. Fix atomic_bool and mutex locking of threads

Release TODO:
2. Save previous bandwidth
-> Use 4mbits as default
-> Bandwidth settings
3. For live streams we have to prune the segments vector so it doesn't grow too large

Issues:
2. Some times it stalls attempting to download, not sure if it is because we attempt to download
the segment as soon as we see it

Features:
1. Seek
2. Rest of addon interface
3. Memory management

Missing Support
1. Other HLS features
