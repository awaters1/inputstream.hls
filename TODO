Multi-threaded TODO
1. Make it work with live streams, right now it doesn't add the segments
when the playlist is reloaded
2. Make it work with variant stream switching - which is disabled at the moment


Priorities:
1. Switching between variant streams
2. Seems to be micropauses when a segment is switched, is it due to the delay
within load_next_segment()? -> Not sure what the exact cause is
3. For live streams we should continually load data as it comes in instead
of only one ahead
4. Seek support for non-live streams



1. Support rest of addon interface
2. Don't keep around old segments?


Issues
1. Memory leak when running in Kodi - maybe due to kodi_hls.cpp not have dest
2. Timestamps
3. Commercial seemed to start randomly - maybe due to discontinuity flag
4. Seeking
5. Sometimes the audio makes a high pitched sound, maybe due to discountinuity tag?

Missing Support
-Tons of HLS features missing
