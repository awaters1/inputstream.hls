demux-rework
1. Switching streams (goes hand in hand with seeking)
2. m_av_contents will continue to grow


1. Demux 
- Has an active segment controller as a data buffer
Seek Forward
- Needs to know which segment contains the position, can use
the segment duration to estimate the time and PTS, but requires
knowing the segments
Seek Backward
- uses byte buffer offset

May need access to the playlist in order to seek forward or backward
to segments we may have not seen yet
-> could just ask the active segment controller

2. Active Segment Controller
- Keeps track of the byte offset for each segment
- Reloads the playlist
- Downloads the segments

3. Session
- Has a demux for each playlist


TODO:
1. Support stream switching
2. Save previous bandwidth
3. Stream the loading of the segments instead of downloading it fully

Idea
1. Instead of having the active segment controller be a part of the session
have the demux be a part of the session and then the demux has an 
active segment controller that can download the data as necessary.  This
will also help when we have to do seeking because the demux will know
where it has to go based on the PTS and then it can tell the controller.

Issues:
1. buffer gets filled too much because it isn't added until it is demuxed
2. Some times it stalls attempting to download, not sure if it is because we attempt to download
the segment as soon as we see it

Features:
1. Seek
2. Rest of addon interface
3. Memory management



Missing Support
1. Other HLS features
