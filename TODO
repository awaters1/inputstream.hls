Priorities:
1. Switching between variant streams
2. Better reloading of the next segment




1. Support rest of addon interface
2. Be able to switch to a variant playlist during playing
3. Support a live stream


Issues
1. Current time seems to be incorrect
2. Micro pauses happen when loading the next segment
3. Audio seems to be misaligned
2. and 3. may happen because of the DMX_STREAMCHANGE, we should only do this if we encounter
a discontinuity tag instead of each TS segment, doesn't seem to be the issue, seems to be
because DemuxRead doesn't return the packet immediately

Missing Support
