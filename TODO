Bugs
1. Seek To position when starting a video
causes a SIGSEV because there are no segments in the playlist
2. The active_playlist isn't thread safe
(could just protect the segments variable)

4. Need to be able to quit everything instead of stalling sometimes when we want to exit
like when downloading
5. Stream switching causes a segment pause in 30 for 30, but worked okay in live stream
-> May be due to resolution change and VAAPI
7. Handle when there is no data, we shoudln't stallin this case
-> can return an empty demux packet to get it to show the loading indicator
9. Discontinuity playlist ends 10  frames too early
10. Sometimes the current time exceeds the total playlist time, may be due to stalling

Seeking
1. Cache file downloads
2. Fix atomic_bool and mutex locking of threads
